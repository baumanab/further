# Steak

- 3 T soy sauce
- 1 T oyster sauce 
- Lots of chopped up garlic.  Chopped well not big chunks

**Marinade if possible though not required**
 
- Use foil then parchment paper on tray in toaster oven. 
- Broil 15 min (will not be super brown but will look almost rubbery)
- Flip steaks over
- Broil 10 mins (likely longer. I just keep doing in 5 min increments – want a little crispy on top)

- If you are comfortable – use a spoon to leave the toaster over ajar while cooking.  Make sure the spoon is not too far in as it will catch on fire.
